Calculator
A basic calculator program that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation, and then displays the result.

Features:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
User-friendly interface.
Chess Game
A simple text-based chess game that allows two players to play against each other. The program displays the chessboard and prompts the players to enter their moves turn by turn. It validates the moves according to the rules of chess and determines the winner or a draw.

Features:

Standard chess rules and movements.
Turn-based gameplay.
Text-based interface.
Genetic Algorithm
An implementation of a simple genetic algorithm to solve a specific problem. The genetic algorithm involves the concepts of selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation. The project should demonstrate how the genetic algorithm iteratively evolves towards finding an optimal or near-optimal solution.

Features:

Representation of individuals and population.
Fitness evaluation function.
Selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
Snake Game
A classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen and eats food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as possible.

Features:

Snake movement and growth logic.
Random food generation.
Score tracking.
Sudoku Puzzle
A program that generates a random Sudoku puzzle and allows the player to solve it. It should include functionality to check the correctness of the solution and provide hints if the player gets stuck.

Features:

Random Sudoku puzzle generation.
Input mechanism for solving the puzzle.
Solution validation and hint system.
Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play on the same computer. The program displays the Tic-Tac-Toe board and prompts the players to enter their moves turn by turn until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

Features:

Interactive board display.
Turn-based gameplay.
Win and draw conditions
